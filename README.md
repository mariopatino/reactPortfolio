# Description
This is a react App portafolio to show my development work, it has some cool animation on the buttons and navigation. I seach for ideas in internet and I found a tutorial to create this Web App, i use windTail framework for CSS, it was a excelent tool and make easy add styles to any element. Instead of use a classic foot the tutorial teachs to contruct a buttons left element, so I use it, it is completly funtional. I enjoy to learn a new framework and the construction was easy and funny.
It is completly responsive an it was contructed mobile first.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
